    I'm Harry (pronouns: he, him). 
    I'm in the final year of my PhD training in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} 
    at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I am advised by 
    [No√©mie Elhadad](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/profil/noemie-elhadad/){:target="_blank"}. 
    For most of my PhD, I was also a Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow at 
    [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Recently, I served a 2-year term on the 
    [Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association](https://academic.oup.com/jamia){:target="_blank"} Student Editorial Board 
    and was a co-organizer of the 2023 [Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium](https://ml4health.github.io/2023/){:target="_blank"}. 
    I am also a [DAAD AInet Fellow](https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/postdocnet/fellows/fellows/){:target="_blank"} through the German
    Academic Exchange Service, Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD).
